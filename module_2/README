# Project 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis

The main idea of this project is to analyse (make an EDA) the dataset which contains characteristics of students' living conditions and decide which of them have an impact on math exam score in order to reveal students who are under risk of getting unsatisfying scores. 

It is essential to:

1. Preview data
2. Clean data from outliers and fill missing values
3. Plot distribution of numeric and categorial data
4. Check the correlation between numeric features
5. Conduct Student's t-test for categorial features

The data contains the following information about students:

1. school — school abbreviation where a student studies

2. sex —  student's sex ('F' - female, 'M' - male)

3. age — student's age (from 15 to 22)

4. address — where a student lives ('U' - urban are, 'R' - rural are)

5. famsize — family size ('LE3' <= 3, 'GT3' >3)

6. Pstatus — student's parents' joint housing ('T' - live together, 'A' - live apart)

7. Medu — mother's education (0 - none, 1 - 4 years, 2 - 5-9 years, 3 - secondary special or 11 years, 4 - higher)

8. Fedu — father's education (0 - none, 1 - 4 years, 2 - 5-9 years, 3 - secondary special or 11 years, 4 - higher)

9. Mjob — mother's job ('teacher', 'health' - healthcare sphere, 'services', 'at_home' - doesn't work, 'other')

10. Fjob — father's job ('teacher', 'health' - healthcare sphere, 'services', 'at_home' - doesn't work, 'other')

11. reason — a reason for choosing a school ('home' - distance from home, 'reputation' - school's reputation, 'course' - educational program, 'other')

12. guardian —  ('mother', 'father', 'other')

13. traveltime — time to get to school (1 - <15 min., 2 - 15-30 min., 3 - 30-60 min., 4 - >60 min.)

14. studytime — study time per week except school time (1 - <2 hours, 2 - 2-5 hours, 3 - 5-10 hours, 4 - >10 hours)

15. failures — school failures (n, if 1<=n<=3, else 0)

16. schoolsup — extra school support (yes or no)

17. famsup — family educational support (yes or no)

18. paid — extra paid math lessons (yes or no)

19. activities — extracurricular activities (yes or no)

20. nursery — went to kindergarten (yes or no)

21. higher — desire to get higher education (yes or no)

22. internet — internet access (yes or no)

23. romantic — in romantic relationships (yes or no)

24. famrel — family relations quality (from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good))

25. freetime — (from 1 (very little) to 5 (a lot of))

26. goout — time for hanging out with friends (from 1 (very little) to 5 (a lot of))

27. health — current health status (from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good))

28. absences - lesson absences
